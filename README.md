<blockquote>
The Pomodoro technique, developed in 1988 by Francisco Cirillo, is an Italian time management method that can be applied to various tasks, whether in studies or at work.
Cirillo's book “The Pomodoro Technique”, created to use time as a valuable ally and accomplish what we want to do and the way we want to do it. In addition, it enables us to continually improve our processes.

<h2> Functionalities </h2>
<p>Using cycles between study/focus and rest, the purpose of the Pomodoro technique is to increase concentration, efficiency and even better time management, whether in studies or at work. Pomodoro cycles are defined by focus, short rest, and long rest. After 03 short rests, the 4th (fourth) is a longer rest, restarting the cycle at the end of the longer rest.</p>
<p>By default, times are set as follows:<p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Focus</strong>: 25 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>Short rest</strong>: 5 minutes</li>
  <li><strong>Longer rest</strong>: 15 minutes</li>
</ul>
