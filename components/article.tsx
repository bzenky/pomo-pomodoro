        <p className="">The Pomodoro Technique is based on the principle of breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each 25-minute work interval is referred to as a &quot;Pomodoro&quot;, and after completing four Pomodoros, a more extended break of 15-30 minutes is taken. The technique is built on the idea that the timer creates a sense of urgency, fostering a focused and immersive work environment. You can adapt the time to be more effective and to what fits your needs.</p>
